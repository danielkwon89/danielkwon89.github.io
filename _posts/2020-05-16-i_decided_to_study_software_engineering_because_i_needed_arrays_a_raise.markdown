I was in my late twenties working as a site manager at the fast-growing urgent care start-up CityMD and I was reeling from a quarter-life crisis that came on like a sudden bout of chest pains. In my moment of existential angst I turned to Google and my soul-searching was answered in the form of a Flatiron School Google ad:

Google really *does* know everything.

This should have been the beginning my of Flatiron School journey but I continued to flirt with the idea of becoming a software engineer for about a year longer while exploring three different paths to get there: coding bootcamps, formal schooling and self-study. At the time, coding bootcamps like Flatiron School and General Assembly were firmly in vogue but still in their nascent stages. I questioned whether 15 weeks was enough time for me to develop legitimate programming skills. I asked myself: “Will I really graduate from the bootcamp with programming skills on par with graduates with CS degrees?” I commenced on another hours-long, wild-eyed Google search squinting into every dusty corner of the Internet, but this time the search was fruitless.

The first concrete steps that I took towards software engineering was when I submitted an application for Arizona State University’s online program. Somewhat ominously, a letter emblazoned with a maroon and gold pitchfork arrived in the mail a few weeks later which I opened with sweaty palms and an accelerating pulse. “Congratulations,” the letter started as my heart leaped, “You’ve been admitted into the Ira. A Fulton Schools of Engineering.” My emotions roared to a crescendo. After student orientation, I jumped through some administrative hoops and enrolled in my first coding classes.

I stopped attending Arizona State about a year later after accepting an I.T. position at CityMD. Although I never completed the software engineering program, my experience there was significant because it was punctuated by the courses that sparked my deep, long-lasting interest in programming.

There’s an exactitude to code that I find satisfying, an exhilaration to constructing miniverses with a few deft keystrokes and imbuing them with attributes. I was terminally hooked, pun intended, on the feeling of serotonin flooding my synapses when I watched code execute flawlessly after hours of Google-sleuthing and despair. Most of all, I felt coding empowered anyone to make an impact — not only in the microcosm of variables and objects but in the actual world for which it’s a metaphor. You just have to decipher the languages first.
